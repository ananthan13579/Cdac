process: info/code/data which help the processor execute the user task
code segment:compiled code or instructions to be executed
data segment: data reqd for execution
info related:metadata abt system variables or system which help in process execution
memory: heap and stack

PRocess control block
process life cycle
new state, ready state(ready queue),running state-processor running the process,terminated state,wait state.
process schedulers
lts(long term), mts,sts,

scheduling algorithms
1.preemptive
2.non  preemptive

arrival time:time at which process arrives in ready queue/ready state
burst time:time taken for process to get executed on CPU
completion time: time at which process completes
total arrival time(TAT):CT-AT
wait time:TAT-BT

first come first serve(non preemptive)
shortest job first(preemptive and non preemptive)
round robin (with time quantum)
priority scheduling algorithm
