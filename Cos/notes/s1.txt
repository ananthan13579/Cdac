What is os?
-hardware manager: manages all resources/components of computer
-process manager: supervises all the tasks/processes being executed by processor.

How is it different from other applications?
-os is installed over hard drive.
-applications also installed over hardware under the layer of os.
-os runs over computer system, applications run over os.
instruction flow: user->application software->os->kernel->hardware

Operating system
manages the hardware of computer 
interface between hardware and software
manages, processes, converts all inputs to o/p with the help of hardware
hardware executes all the code.
os is hardware dependent. os is itself a software, it is always installed on some storage
as os is software, it require physical memory for execution.inputs intermediate processes output all require hardware.
os may produce certain intermediate results which need to be stored in,say register and cache.
speed of register is almost similar to speed of processor.
os installed on hardware(hardware dependent), applications installedd on os.


functions:mgmt of processes,memory,device,disk,network,security

kernel of an operating system is responsible for managing and executing programs
user and system calls:interrupts and system calls
memory hierarchy:primary-ram(sram,dram),rom(prom,eeprom,eprom),secondary-hdd,magnetic disk,usb pendrive,cd,floppy
types of os:batch, multiprogramming,multiprocessor,distributed,desktop, server

Intro to linux
-open source os ie available for free and modified by user acc to their needs
-low cost/ no cost, secure, possible to multitask, secure, stable and scalable, networking, cli command line interface,gui graphic unit interface,better file system
/ is root directory
/bin user binaries||/sbin system binaries||/etc configuration files||/dev device files||/proc process info||/var variable files||/tmp temporary files||/usr user programs
/home parent directory of user friendly directory||/boot boot loader files||/opt apps||/lib system libraries

nano-open an existing file/ creating a file.runs nano editor and open specified file.
date: display date and time in linux.
ls:list out all files of pwd
ls -l
touch to create a new file
mkdir: create new directory
chmod change mod: change permissions||rm remove file
ps: list all currently running processes
pwd: print working directory
