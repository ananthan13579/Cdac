Java enforces type safety to ensure that variables are used consistently with their declared types. 
This helps catch potential errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, leading to more robust and reliable code.
It prevents situations where a variable is used in an unintended way, which could lead to unpredictable behavior or runtime errors.
