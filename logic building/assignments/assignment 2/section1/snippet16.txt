public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int num = 10;
double result = num / 4;
System.out.println(result);
}
}

code returns with the result as 2.0. this result is expected because a int to double type conversion is possible.
this happens because there is no loss of precision when going from int datatype to double.
