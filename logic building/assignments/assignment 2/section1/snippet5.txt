public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Main method with String[] args");
}
public static void main(int[] args) {
System.out.println("Overloaded main method with int[] args");
}
}

Code will run without any errors
output will be "Main method with String[] args"
Yes, main can have multiple methods, method with argument String[] args will be called
The overloaded main method with int[] args will not be called automatically. 
To invoke it,it needs to be called explicitly from within the code.
