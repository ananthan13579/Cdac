public class Main {
public static int main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
return 0;
}
}


error: 'main' method is not declared with a return type of 'void'.
code compiles however there is a runtime error.
Java runtime will not recognize the entry point for the application without 'void' keyword.
The void return type is mandatory because the main method does not return a value to the runtime. 
It simply executes the code within it and then terminates.
