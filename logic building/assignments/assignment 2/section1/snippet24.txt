public class MissingBreakCase {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int level = 1;
switch(level) {
case 1:
System.out.println("Level 1");
case 2:
System.out.println("Level 2");
case 3:
System.out.println("Level 3");
default:
System.out.println("Unknown level");
}
}
}
output is "Level 1" "Level 2" "Level 3" "Unknown level" as there is no break statement to exit the case after its execution. break statement is important so that only the required case is executed.
